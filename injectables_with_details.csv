The ability to perform procedures in the standing position is more important in the horse than in other species because of the greater risk of complications associated with anesthesia in equine species.1 This is of increased concern in the case of procedures in mature horses. There are numerous drugs approved for use in horses for standing..."

Bleeding can occur during or after exertion, and can take weeks to resolve in some horses.1 This condition is known as exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), or bleeding from the lungs. This occurs often in performance horses and is a significant cause of exercise intolerance. EIPH occurs primarily in Quarter Horses, Standardbreds..."

Swelling may be present in one leg, only the hind legs, or in all four legs. In general, swelling tends to occur more readily in the hind legs, and has been referred to as “filling” or “stocking up.”1 Obviously, a horse’s legs are in the lower part of the body. Thus, due to gravity, fluid can build up within the tissues. This is known as edema, and can..."
